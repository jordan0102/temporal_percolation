Testing randomizer.cpp

    g++ -O -Wall randomizer.cpp -o randomizer

    cat net.edg | ./randomizer 10 4 3466 > netr.edg 



------------------------------------------------------------
	Check that the degree distributions are the same 

  g++ -O -Wall degrees.cpp -o degrees 

 
 cat net.edg | ./degrees 100  > net.degrees
 cat netr.edg | ./degrees 100  > netr.degrees

diff net.degrees netr.degrees 



Tried this for several different network files net.edg.
The randomizer seems to keep the degree distributions intact.

Let's find answers to these questions by starting with a network that
has a strong community structure. We'll mix it with randomizer one,
two, several, and many times, and detect all communities from both
networks. When community structure is eliminated, we may assume that
the network is properly scrambled. 



Generate a community network of size 50 000. 
Params: 
   N=50 000
   p(Nrand=1)=0.95,  p(Nrand=1)=0.05
   Nwalks ~ U[0,3]
   seed: ER-network, size 10, <k>=2
   random number generator ranmar, seed 19274 


Randomize it with 
1L
2L
5L
10L
20L
50L
100L
  iterations




Detect (3-clique-)communities with CFinder. 

Look at how the number of 3-clique-communities changed in
randomization: 3-clique-community size statistics below,
and figure testingRandomizer.eps.

The k-clique-communities with k > 3 diminish even more quickly in
randomization. 


****************************************************************************
*  It is clear that the community structure diminishes quickly with the    *
*  first few rounds and stabilizes to some random structure. The last      *
*  four cases (10L, 20L, 50L, 100L) are practically the same. 10 rounds    *
*  seems to be sufficient for this network to eliminate all nonrandom      *
*  community structure.                                                    *    
*                                                                          *
